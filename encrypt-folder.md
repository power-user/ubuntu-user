1. Google for _ubuntu encrypt folder_.
2. First result is https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FolderEncryption (last edited in October 2012).
3. Try out `encfs`, which is at version 1.7.4 (released November 2010) at Ubuntu 14.10.
4. https://github.com/vgough/encfs is alive, so there should be a future for this project.
5. encfs 1.7.4 as packaged in Ubuntu is usable as described in `FolderEncryption` page.
